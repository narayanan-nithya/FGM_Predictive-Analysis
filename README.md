# Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting prevalence - Geo_Spatial_Survival Analysis

### Background Information 

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines as as all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons. FGM can cause both short/long term [health problems such as excessive bleeding, vaginal inflammation caused by bacteria and newborn death](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/female-genital-mutilation).  Despite these negative health consequences and intensified eradiation efforts, FGM has continuously been performed partly because of the [evidence gaps](https://www.popcouncil.org/research/evidence-to-end-fgm-c-research-to-help-girls-and-women-thrive1) that hinder a comprehensive evidence-based approach to FGM. 


We believe that data scientists can help presenting evidence indicating what could potentially work for reducing the numbers of FGM.

### Goal

The goal of this study is to examine what factors might reduce or even end FGM and how long it might take to eradicate it. 

### Methodology

Analyze the Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting prevalence in African , middle eastern ethnicities. Data sources - UNICEF, MICS, DHS surveys. Look at these practices in various regions of Africa and Middle Eastern countries. We will analyze factors that potentially impact the practice such as socio-economic factors like education, poverty and employment of women. We also plan to derive a prediction on the practice prevalence ending.
